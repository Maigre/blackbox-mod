/*
 * WHERE DID IT DIE? The instrument, rebuilt 2026-10-11 because the previous one could not survive the event it was
 * built to measure. Three "facts" about the Relapse hang came out of it and all three were artifacts:
 *
 *   1. "The fault recorder caught nothing, so nothing faulted." The record was 13 words at 0x38800fd0, and backup
 *      SRAM ENDS AT 0x38800fff - so its last word landed at 0x38801000, outside the 4 KB. That write bus-faults
 *      INSIDE the fault handler, which escalates to lockup, and the magic (written last, deliberately) never
 *      lands. A genuine fault therefore left no record. test_fault.py now runs the recorder and fails on the
 *      overrun; the layout below is bounded by a static assert instead of a comment.
 *   2. "All the fault status registers were clear." CFSR / HFSR live in the SCB, which every reset clears, so
 *      after the watchdog reboot they are ALWAYS clear. The reading carried no information.
 *   3. "MODE said Munchi was the last type to complete a block", and the 3.2.p breadcrumb likewise - both are
 *      rewritten by the delay's every audio block, so within a millisecond of the reboot they describe the
 *      REBOOTED unit. Proved on his unit over USB: a sentinel poked into the crumb was gone before the read back.
 *
 * So: the trail is now LATCHED AT BOOT (instrument_boot, called once per boot from master_alloc) into a saved copy
 * that the running unit never touches, and the reset itself is caught in the act - the window watchdog's early
 * wakeup interrupt fires one tick (~5 ms) before it resets the unit, and its handler records the PC the CPU was
 * spinning on.
 *
 * BACKUP SRAM, 4 KB at 0x38800000, and the free span above master.c's PRISM_CHECK is 0x38800f78..0x38800fff:
 *   0x38800f78  FAULT   13 words  magic "FLT1", PC, LR, xPSR, CFSR, HFSR, MMFAR, BFAR, EXC_RETURN, r0-r3
 *   0x38800fac  WDG      8 words  magic "WDG1", PC, LR, xPSR, stamp A age, stamp B age, misses, CR | SR << 16
 *   0x38800fcc  TRAIL    6 words  the live breadcrumb ring (munchi.cpp's DROP), newest at TRAIL_IDX
 *   0x38800fe4  IDX      1 word   boot count << 8 | ring index
 *   0x38800fe8  SAVED    6 words  the ring as it stood when the unit last booted: the trail INTO the hang
